Put the reset button closer to the STM32
Put the supply indicator LEDs closer to the actual supply, and the test LEDs near the test points they're connected to
Something seems wrong with the diodes on the MOSFET switching circuits. The part is not working properly on the board.
Make ground lines thicker, and make the supply lines to the output much bigger
